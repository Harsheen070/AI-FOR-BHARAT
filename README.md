# AI-Based Geospatial Monitoring System

This repository contains the system design and requirements for an AI-powered geospatial monitoring solution that leverages satellite imagery and cloud infrastructure to detect, analyze, and visualize spatial-temporal anomalies.

The system integrates satellite data ingestion, preprocessing pipelines, machine learning–based analytics, and interactive visualization dashboards to support large-scale monitoring and decision-making.

## Repository Structure
- `requirements.md` – Functional and non-functional system requirements
- `design.md` – Detailed system design and architecture documentation

This repository focuses on **technical design clarity, scalability, and deployment readiness**.
